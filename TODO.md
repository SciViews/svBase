# svBase To Do list

-   Should `rownames()` and `rownames<-()` get and assign to `.rownames` for data/table and tbl_df objects? Should we do something similar for keys in data.table or tbl_df?

-   Display more information in the `print()` methods of data.frame, data.table and tbl_df: help page, comment, labels units, ... See: vignette("extending", package = "pillar"). Also indicate key for data.table object.
